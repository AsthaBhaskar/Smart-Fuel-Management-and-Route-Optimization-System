# Smart-Fuel-Management-and-Route-Optimization-System

This is a system designed to help maritime operations optimize fuel consumption and plan efficient routes. It leverages machine learning and optimization algorithms to provide valuable insights and decision support.

**Key Features:**

* **Fuel Consumption Prediction:**  Uses a Gradient Boosting Regressor model trained on historical data to estimate fuel consumption based on vessel and environmental factors.
* **Route Optimization:** Employs a Simulated Annealing algorithm to find the most fuel-efficient route between waypoints, considering factors like distance, weather, and vessel characteristics.
* **Data Visualization:** Provides interactive dashboards to explore and analyze fuel consumption trends, route performance, and other relevant data.

**Benefits:**

* **Reduced Fuel Costs:** By optimizing routes and minimizing fuel consumption, EcoRoute can significantly reduce operational expenses for maritime businesses.
* **Environmental Sustainability:** Lower fuel usage leads to reduced emissions, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable maritime industry.
* **Improved Decision-Making:** Data-driven insights from EcoRoute can empower operators to make informed choices about vessel deployment and route planning.

**How to Use:**

1. **Data Preparation:** Ensure you have a well-structured dataset containing vessel information, environmental data, and historical fuel consumption records.
2. **Model Training:** Train the Gradient Boosting Regressor model on your data using the provided `main.py` script.
3. **Route Optimization:** The `main.py` script also includes functions for user-defined route optimization. Specify start and end points (latitude/longitude coordinates) and receive the most fuel-efficient route via the Simulated Annealing algorithm.
4. **Integration:** Consider integrating EcoRoute with your existing fleet management systems for real-time data processing and visualization.

**Technologies:**

* Python
* Pandas
* scikit-learn
* Streamlit (for web app development, optional)

**Future Development:**

* Integrating real-time weather data for more accurate fuel consumption predictions.
* Expanding route optimization capabilities to handle dynamic factors like traffic and weather changes.
* Developing a user interface for seamless interaction with EcoRoute's functionalities.
